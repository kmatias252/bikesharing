# Bikesharing

## Overview of Bikesharing Analysis:

The purpose of this analysis is to develop a proposal that will provide evidence to key stakeholders looking to invest in a bike-sharing program in Des Moines, Iowa. Using Citi bike data from a NYC bike sharing program, this project will require the use of Pandas to change the “tripduration” column from an integer to a datetime datatype. Then through the use of  Tableau, the following visualizations will be created in order to convince investors in developing a bike sharing program:
  * Show the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders
  * Show the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week
  * Show the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week
